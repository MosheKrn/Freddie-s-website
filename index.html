      Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara) 5 September 1946 â€“ 24 November 1991 was a British singer-songwriter.</br>
      He was best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band Queen.</br>
      Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music.</br>
      He was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range.</br>
      Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his theatrical style, influencing the artistic direction of Queen.

          The search is very generaly, for example, if I want to search for information about the State of Israel I need to perform a specific search,
        if I search only for the word 'Israel' I will get information that may not refer to the State of Israel itself
         But for a sports game in which Israel participates
        </th>
        <th>
          The search is performed by tags, In other words, if I search for the word Israel and on the other hand someone who publishes information about the State of Israel to the country that it will appear in my search, he will have to tag everything he wants to publish, from moderation, video, link and more.
        </th>
        <th>
          Web 3.0 search engines retrieving micro content  texts which were tagged automatically. The result could be more precise search because tagging can solve part of the ambiguity that homonyms and synonyms  introduce into the process of
          Search. That's why when i wiil search enter the word 'israel' i will get the information about state of israel and the main news about it
